| 1\. Intro: From the very beginning, actuarial science has been a discipline in statistical modeling that has been driven by practical problems in insurance.                                                                                                                                                                   | This introduces the history of the actuarial profession and the fundamental ideas it was built on. Learning about the field guides us into understanding how it's changing in the modern day.                                                                                                                       |
| 2\. Non-Life Insurance: There is the pricing actuary who designs and prices (new) insurance products, and there is the reserving actuary who predicts cash flows of insurance claims (which typically run over multiple years). These predictions are used for insurance accounting, risk management, and product development. | This is defining a subset of the actuarial field. This section discusses pricing models and new changes to the models, which connects to the thesis of the field using new technology to advance the practice. The section goes in depth on GLMs and neural networks, which are both evolving methods being used.   |
| 2.3 Claim Reserving: Claims reserving in non-life insurance is concerned with predicting claims cash flows that can                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 last over multiple years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | This is another section within non-life insurance that heavily uses statistical prediction methods, which is now at the heart of actuarial science. Predicting probabilities of future events is the main revolutionized area of the field.                                                                         |
| 3\. Life Insurance: Life and pension insurance insures life and protects against disability and death of individual policyholders over possibly their entire lifetimes.                                                                                                                                                        | Life insurance works by having an optimal portfolio, which it turn requires knowledge of economic and statistical models. This area also needs social respondsibility, and anyone working with life insurance needs to be in-tune with all current advancements in technology and working against model bias.       |
| 3.2 Mortality Modeling: The more statistical part of life and pension insurance modeling is mortality forecasting.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Mortality rates almost exclusively uses statistical models, which is why life insurance is so closely tied with using all available information.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3.3 Product Design: Because life and pension insurance are of a long-term nature, product design is especially important to guaranteeing long-term financial stability.                                                                                                                                                        | Within life insurance, it's important to consider how pension and insurance products effect real people. External factors like climate, politics, and events like Covid-19 are important to incorporate into models.                                                                                                |
| 4.1 Reinsurance: The reinsurance industry provides specific services and products so that the primary (direct) insurers, referred to as ceding companies, can cap or reengineer their insurance product                                                                                                                        
 portfolios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Reinsurance and other risk management methods require a lot of knowledge and customization to customers. To provide relevant/useless products, companies need to constantly stay up to date with new technology and information.                                                                                    |
| 4.2 Risk Measures: Since the early 1970s, capital adequacy regulation for banking and insurance has undergone major changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | This section mostly focuses on the big changes in how actuaries measure risk. There has been a big shift away from traditional guidelines to better fit the modern age.                                                                                                                                             |
| 4.3 Cyber & Operational Risk: Operational risk no doubt constitutes a fundamental risk class for banks as well as for insurance companies.                                                                                                                                                                                     | Cyber risk is a newer form of operational risk that is still being analyzed and requires constant new research.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 5\. Conclusion: A modern actuarial qualification includes education in legislation, economics, accounting, professional behavior, and communication, and such a qualification also asks for a recognized program of continuous professional development to not lose sight of the evolving state of the art.                    | This reiterates the idea that the actuarial profession needs to continuously evolve and take advantage of all new information and methods to stay relevant and accurate.                                                                                                                                            |

I personally don't see any major gaps. I skipped some subsections
because there was also a small paragraph for the topic or it was overly
redundant. I think the main sections did a great job of breaking down
the field into two sections (life and non life) and then discussing the
most relevant/actively evolving topics within the two groups.
